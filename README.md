# Movie-Recommendation-and-Rating

This is a Movie recommendation and reviews application which takes the movie name as input and presents with the ratings. Also we get movie recommendations which are refreshed every day. Built in MVP architecture by integrating REST API from IMDb, TMDB, and Giphy Python packages. Built a docker container using Google Cloud and pushed the docker image to the container registry and hosted the application on cloud run using datastore as the backend.
